### Changed

- Case `lightFlash` (White Flash) leaves the loot pool after the light theme achievement is unlocked

## [1.68.4] — 2026-07-15

## [1.68.1] — 2026-07-15

### Changed

- Case `screenShake` reward lasts 10 seconds

### Fixed

- Light theme: case opener card no longer picks up a muddy gold wash; reel stays a dark CS well instead of blending with page background

## [1.67.2] — 2026-07-15

## [1.67.1] — 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Case `rickroll` drop opens YouTube again (gesture-reserved tab; popup blockers were killing the post-spin `window.open`)

## [1.67.0] — 2026-07-15

## [1.66.0] — 2026-07-15

## [1.65.3] — 2026-07-15

## [1.63.2] — 2026-07-15

## [1.61.0] — 2026-07-15

### Added

- CS-style case opener under My Steam (weighted reel, joke drops, 1% Covert Drop achievement)
- New achievement `caseJackpot` (Covert Drop)

## [1.60.0] — 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Project `capsule__art` (and capsule hover / tags) adopt light-theme tokens instead of hard-coded Steam-dark fills

## [1.59.1] — 2026-07-15

### Changed

- Hero display name follows locale: Кирилл / Кирило / Kirill (ru / uk / en); other UI languages use Kirill

### Changed

- Crawlable SEO (title, description, OG/Twitter, JSON-LD, noscript, heading fallbacks, OG image) is English

- Static heading / skip-link fallbacks and `<noscript>` summary for crawlers
- Joke avatar tip on hero role hover («не только Frontend…» / i18n)

- Shared Steam-style scrollbars (dark track / beveled thumb, light-theme tokens)
- Avatar speech queue: timed lines wait their turn (no interrupt / no duplicate identities)
- Avatar tip after 90s on the site if no achievements yet («А ты знал, что на сайте есть достижения?» / i18n)
- Achievement «Full Spawn» / «Полный спавн»: spawn every language flag, avatar, stack tech, and AI tool — effect auto-drops missing ones on later visits (no duplicates of already present bodies)
- More avatar speech beats while playing with hero physics objects (tips at 5 / 10 / 15 / 25 interactions)

- Activity “all maxed” summary copy reframed as another overnight grind

- Achievement «Broke Everything» / «Всё сломал»: mine every major UI shell with the Minecraft pickaxe (infinite echo feed ignored / hidden while mining)
- Achievement «There Is a Bottom» / «Дно всё-таки есть»: catch the footer despite infinite scroll — it panics, jokes, then vanishes
- Comment wall enter / leave motion (staggered appear, red wipe on mod-delete)
- Comment reactions use like / dislike (thumbs + separate counts) instead of score voting
- Shared Steam-style achievement unlock toast + `window.achievement` console debug API

- Achievement unlock date shown in the achievements drawer (localized)
- Hero avatar hover tip («Ну давай кликни на меня!» / i18n) with stronger accent glow

### Changed

- Hero physics body caps doubled (balls 56, AI 32, flags 24, avatars 16)
- ProxyChecker temporarily hidden from the projects shelf

- Infinite-scroll text decay is stronger and ramps sooner (higher budgets, faster depth curve)
- Infinite-scroll CSS warp / stage drift starts later (from loop 6; mid/deep stages delayed)
- Scroll-top control: in the infinite zone the progress ring hides and the chevron becomes the current echo loop number (animated)

## [1.54.2] — 2026-07-14

### Changed
